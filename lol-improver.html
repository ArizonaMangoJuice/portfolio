                  is an app that lets you take notes on champions. 
                  Allowing you to see which champions you struggle against. 
                  Lol Improver lets you find player statistics.
                  This app user React, MongoDB, Express, and mocha, chai, enzyme and, jest.
                  You can find the repo <a href="https://github.com/ArizonaMangoJuice/lol-improver-client">here</a>.

                <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
                <p>I had to see if the riot api allowed you to grab static data:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>Champion data</li>
                   <li>Champion picture url</li>
                   <li>Being able to search for players</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After looking over the api documentation I was able:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>to grab all champion static data and save it to the database</li>
                   <li>to grab a players info and save it to the database</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="biggest-task">Making the least amount of api calls was the biggest priority</p>

           </div>
          <div>
             <div>
                <h3>SOLUTIONS</h3>
                <p>
                  The first thing I did was save to the static data I got from the api in a json file.
                  After, I Created models for the player and the user.
                  With those out of the way I was able to add notes to the champions of the user fairly easily.
                  Lastly I added authentication to my endpoints, except for the player search.
                  Player search functionality is open for anybody.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More customization will be added to the user profile, where users could set their player name, allowing for more detailed note taking showing matches and winrate against the champions.
                  I will also add a public page for searching players and seeing best current builds in the near future.

                <p>
                  The end result is a good foundation to build on.
                  I will constantly be working on this project, this page will change and evolve with it.

      <h1>Hi, my name is
          <span>Isael Lizama</span>
      </h1>
      <h2>I'm a
          <span>full stack</span> developer
      </h2>
      <p>
          Being a web developer taught me how to think critically about what im going to do and how i'm going to do it.
          The idea of creating something from scratch that didn't exist before is amazing.
          One of the best things about being a web developer is, new technologies come out and make the developing more interesting.
          You'll never be bored.
          Also, the feeling that you can work as a team, create an app that will help multiple people is one of the best feelings I have ever felt. 
          When i'm not developing I also love doing anything that is competitive, building and fixing computers,
          and hanging out with friends.
      </p>
