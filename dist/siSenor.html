                  is an app that lets you memorize spanish words. 
                  Allowing you to see words you don't understand more often than the words you already know. 
                  This app uses React, MongoDB, Express, and mocha, chai, enzyme and, jest.

                <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
                <p>The biggest challenge was seeing if we can implement a algorithm that showed wrong answers more often than right:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>started simple, used an array and pushed back the answer if the user answered correctly</li>
                   <li>We later used a linked list that moved instead of an array</li>
                   <li>The final algorithm we used was a linked list that used a memory value to push the word m spots if correct and push the 1 spot if answered wrong</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After figuring out the algorithm all we had to do on the client side was:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>Create word card</li>
                   <li>Create login form</li>
                   <li>Create sign up form</li>
                </ul>
             </div>
          </div>
          <div>
              <div class="blank-div">&nbsp;</div>
           </div>
          <div>
             <div>
                <h3>SOLUTIONS</h3>
                <p>
                  The first thing we did was create the algorithm.
                  After, I Created models for the player and the user.
                  With those out of the way I was able to add notes to the champions of the user fairly easily.
                  Lastly I added authentication to my endpoints, except for the player search.
                  Player search functionality is open for anybody.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More customization will be added to the user profile, where users could set their player name, allowing for more detailed note taking showing matches and winrate against the champions.
                  I will also add a public page for searching players and seeing best current builds in the near future.
                </p>

                <h3>RESULTS</h3>
                <p>
                  The end result is a good foundation to build on.
                  I will constantly be working on this project, this page will change and evolve with it.
